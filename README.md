# sumOfThrees
Given a number n, return a string representing it as a sum of distinct powers of three, or return "Impossible" if that's not possible to achieve.

Example:

For n="4", the output should be sumOfThrees("4") = "3^1+3^0". 
4 can be represented as 3+1 which is in fact 3 to the power of 1 plus 3 to the power of 0
For n="2", the output should be sumOfThrees("2") = "Impossible" There is no way to represent 2 as a sum of distinct powers of 3.
